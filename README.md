## 📌 Project Overview

This project consolidates key cybersecurity skills developed during a 3-month intensive training. It involves setting up a virtual lab, analyzing an Android forensic image, and (optionally) deploying a virtual firewall.

### 🎯 Objectives

1. Set up a fully functional **virtual cybersecurity lab**
2. Conduct a full **Android forensics investigation**
3. *(Optional)* Deploy and test a **virtual firewall** using pfSense

## 🔧 Project Scope

### Part I – Virtual Cybersecurity Lab Setup

- ✅ Installed Type 2 Hypervisor (VirtualBox)
- ✅ Configured Virtual Machines:
  - Kali Linux (Attacker)
  - Windows 10 (Target)
- ✅ Internal NATLab network established
- ✅ Verified connectivity via:
  - Ping test
  - Shared folders
  - Nmap service enumeration

> **Minimum Specs per VM:**  
> RAM: 2GB | Storage: 20GB | CPU: Dual-core+

### Part II – Android Forensics Analysis

- 🔍 Used forensic tools (Autopsy) to analyze an Android image file.
- 🧪 Extracted data included:
  - SMS, Contacts, Call Logs
  - App usage, Browser history, Deleted content
- 📄 Compiled a full **Digital Forensics Report**:
  - Methodology & tools used
  - Screenshots of findings
  - Key evidence & interpretations
  - Final recommendations

### Part III – (Optional) Virtual Firewall Deployment

- 🧱 Deployed pfSense virtual firewall
- 🌐 Configured WAN/LAN interfaces, NAT, DNS, DHCP
- 🔒 Applied firewall rules to:
  - Block HTTPS traffic
  - Log and test traffic filtering
- 🧾 Documented setup steps and test outputs

🛠 Tools Used
VirtualBox – VM management

Kali Linux – Security testing and enumeration

Nmap – Service discovery and enumeration

Autopsy – Android image forensic analysis

pfSense – Firewall deployment and testing

🧠 Learning Outcomes
✔️ Built and managed a secure virtual lab
✔️ Performed foundational Android mobile forensics
✔️ Documented findings with professional reporting standards
✔️ (Optional) Deployed basic firewall rules in a simulated enterprise network

📌 Deliverables
✅ Cyber Lab Setup Documentation

✅ Android Forensics Report (PDF)

✅ Firewall Configuration Summary
